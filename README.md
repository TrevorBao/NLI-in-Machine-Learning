# NLI-in-Machine-Learning

Given a premise and a hypothesis, determine if the hypothesis is true based on the premise. This task uses a traditional machine learning approach, combining SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest in an ensemble with GradientBoosting as the final estimator, and compares its performance to a deep learning-based attention GRU model.

To check the model performance, go to the Demo notebook, change the dataset file source you use, and click on the run button.

The data sources for training, validation and testing are provided by the University of Manchester. The sentence embedding are trained using SBERT.
