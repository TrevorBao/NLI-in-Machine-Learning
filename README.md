# NLI-in-Machine-Learning
Given a premise and a hypothesis, determine if the hypothesis is true based on the premise. This task uses a traditional machine learning approach, combining SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest in an ensemble with GradientBoosting as the final estimator, and compares its performance to a deep learning-based attention GRU model.
